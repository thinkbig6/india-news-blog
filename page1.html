      <p>
        The sixth phase of the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 recorded a voter turnout of 60.19% across 58 constituencies spanning 8 states. 
        West Bengal reported the highest turnout with over 75%, while urban regions like Delhi saw relatively lower participation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This phase saw prominent leaders such as Maneka Gandhi, Manoj Tiwari, and others in the fray. 
        The Election Commission has reported that polling was largely peaceful, with minor EVM glitches quickly resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security was beefed up across sensitive zones, and over 1.5 lakh polling booths were operational.
        The final and seventh phase is expected to take place on May 25, followed by vote counting on June 4.
